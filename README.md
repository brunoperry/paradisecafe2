## Description

I played this legendary ZX-Spectrum 48K game back in the 80's and all I can remember is how cool and "illegal" it was back then, so I decided to make a web version remake of the game.

Apart from the orignal content, this is a list of new characters and levels I've added so far:

- Boy scout (character)
- Crackhouse (level)
- Dark alley (level)

I will keep adding more characters and levels just for the fun of it :)

If you ever played this game before I hope this would bring good memories!
