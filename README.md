## Description

I played this legendary game back in the 80's and all I could remember was how cool and "illegal" it was back then :)

The idea came from [falsovsky](https://github.com/falsovsky/paradise.js) who is doing a similar project. I decided to give it a try and make my own remake of the game.

Some game design was added because the original had some critically flaws. I added the scout character that fixed some of those flaws and added a "dope house" level just for the funs!

If you ever played this game before, I hope this would bring some good memories!
