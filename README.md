## Description

I played this legendary game back in the 80's and all I can remember is how cool and "illegal" it was back then :)

I got the idea from [falsovsky](https://github.com/falsovsky/paradise.js) who is doing a similar project. I decided to give it a try and make my own remake of the game.

Some game design was added because the original had some critically flaws.

This is the list of new characters and levels I added so far:

- Boy scout (character)
- Crackhouse (level)
- Dark alley (level)

I will keep adding more characters and levels just for the fun of it :)

If you ever played this game before, I hope this would bring some good memories!
